        <h2>What you need to do...</h2>
        <p>The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974  and the Management of Health and Safety at  Work Regulations 1999 place duties on companies and individuals to ensure that  adequate provision is made for health and safety at work. Employers must  ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of  employees and any others who may be affected by what they do. This includes  employees, any casual workers, part-timers, trainees, customers or contractors.  It will also include those who may be affected by work activities, eg  neighbours, sales people and members of the public. </p>

	<h2 id="what">What is risk assessment? </h2>
    <p>As farmers and growers, you use management systems to ensure  that you keep crops and animals healthy and productive, and to enable you to  stay in business. You plan what to plant and when, assess the risks of diseases  and other incidents that may spoil the crop or animal. You control any  problems, monitor growth, decide when to harvest, and store products in a way  that ensures they stay fresh. You also work out how successful you have been  and come up with improvements.</p>
      <p>Managing health and safety is no different – you need to  manage it to ensure that you, your workers, family members and others are safe  at work.</p>
      <p>Risk assessment is a careful look at what, in your business,  could cause harm to people, so that you can decide whether you have taken  enough precautions or should do more. The law does not expect you to eliminate  risk, but to protect people as far as ‘reasonably practicable’. Doing the  assessment and taking action is what matters. </p>
      <p id="_How_do_I">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>
<h2 id="how">How do I assess the risk?</h2>
    <p>Follow the five steps below.</p>
      <p>A  ‘hazard’ is anything that might cause harm, such as working from ladders or  electricity.</p>
    <p> The ‘risk’ is the chance that someone could be harmed by these hazards.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spot hazards by walking around your workplace and watching how  people work.</li>
        <li>Learn from experience. Think carefully about any past accidents  or illnesses as these can help you pick out the less obvious hazards.</li>
        <li>Ask people who work for you what they think. They may have  spotted something you have not noticed. </li>
        <li>Check the manufacturers’ instructions for equipment or data  sheets for chemicals to help you spot the hazards.</li>
        <li>Don’t forget to think about long-term health hazards as well as the more  obvious safety hazards.      </li>
    </ul>
      <p id="_Risk_Assessment_Step">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>
<h2 id="risk1">Risk assessment step 1: What are the  hazards?</h2>
      <p>A ‘hazard’ is anything that might cause harm, such as working  from ladders or electricity.<br />
        The ‘risk’ is the chance that someone could be harmed by  these hazards.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spot  hazards by walking around your workplace and watching how people work.</li>
        <li>Learn  from experience. Think carefully about any past accidents or illnesses as these  can help you pick out the less obvious hazards.</li>
        <li>Ask  people who work for you what they think. They may have spotted something you  have not noticed. </li>
        <li>Check  the manufacturers’ instructions for equipment or data sheets for chemicals to  help you spot the hazards.</li>
        <li>Don’t  forget to think about long-term health hazards as well as the more obvious  safety hazards.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="_Risk_Assessment_Step_">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>
<h2 id="risk2">Risk assessment step 2: Who might be  harmed and how?</h2>
    <p>For each hazard you need to be clear about who might be  harmed, eg employees, casual workers, members of the public, contractors and  family, especially children. Think about the more vulnerable people, eg  untrained or new workers, expectant mothers, visitors and maintenance workers. </p>
      <p>Work out how they might be harmed and how, eg being killed  by a bale or vehicle, injured by falling through a fragile roof, or suffering  long-term health problems from breathing in grain dust. </p>
      <p id="_Risk_Assessment_Step_1">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>
<h2 id="risk3">Risk assessment step 3: Weigh up the  risks and decide on precautions </h2>
    <p>For each hazard you need to look at:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> what you are already doing;</li>
        <li> the controls you have in place; and </li>
        <li> the way the work is organised;</li>
        </ul>
      <p> and compare them to what you need to do to comply with the  law. If there is a gap between what you are doing and the standard that applies,  you must take action. </p>
      <p>For example, if you had an unguarded power take-off shaft it  would be no good to simply tell workers not to go near it. What you need to do to  comply with the law is have a well-maintained and effective guard. This means  there is a big gap between what is in place and what should be in place. You  would have to take action to install a new guard and then maintain it in good  working order.</p>
      <p>If you can, you must eliminate the hazard altogether, but if  you cannot do this, then you must control the risks in the following order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> try introducing a less risky option, eg  switching to a less harmful chemical;</li>
        <li> prevent access to the hazard, eg securing a  slurry pit or guarding a machine;</li>
        <li> organise work to reduce exposure to the hazard, eg  putting barriers between people and vehicles;</li>
        <li> provide personal protective equipment, eg  clothing or footwear;</li>
        <li> provide welfare facilities, eg first aid and  showers for removing contamination.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="_Risk_Assessment_Step_2">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>
<h2 id="risk4">Risk assessment step 4: Put the  results into practice</h2>
    <p>A risk assessment is not an end in itself. It will not stop  someone dying, being injured or made ill. This will only happen if you take  action to deal with the hazards and risks you find.  </p>
      <p>If you find there are many improvements needed, big and  small, don’t try to do everything at once. Deal with the most important things  first, eg those that could kill, seriously injure or cause serious illness. </p>
      <p>Make sure everyone who works on your farm knows about the  results of your assessment and understands the controls you have put in place.  Share information about hazards and risks with those who need it, eg tell contractors  about asbestos in buildings. </p>
      <p>If you employ five or more people then you must write down  the significant findings of your assessment. See some <a href="../experience/transport.htm">examples of completed risk  assessments</a>.</p>
      <p id="_Risk_Assessment_Step_3">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>
<h2 id="risk5">Risk assessment step 5: Check  controls stay in place and review the assessment</h2>
  <p>Regularly check that your controls stay in place. You need to  ensure that you are still improving or at least not letting standards slip  back. </p>
      <p>No workplace remains the same. Eventually you will buy new  equipment or change ways of working that might bring in new hazards. If there  is a significant change you need to respond to it straight away and review your  assessment.</p>
      <p>Why not decide on an annual date to review your risk  assessment, so that even if there have not been any significant changes during  the year, you leave yourself some flexibility to anticipate change and ensure you  miss nothing? </p>
      <p id="_Consultation">[<a href="#top">back to top</a>]</p>
<h2 id="consultation">Consultation</h2>
    <p>Employers have a legal obligation to consult employees on  their health and safety at work. Where there is no recognised union you can  choose to do this directly with individuals or through representatives elected  from the workforce or use a combination of both. You must consult about  anything that could significantly affect employee health and safety.</p>
