      <li>You       have been involved in the purchase of a product using our website.</li>
      <li>You have registered on one of our online collaboration or membership services.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="data-protection-rights">Your data protection rights</h2>
    <p>Under data protection law, you have rights we need to make you aware of.  The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your  information.</p>
    <h3>Your right of access</h3>
    <p>You have the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-of-access/">right to ask</a> us for copies of your personal information. This right always applies. There are some exemptions, which means you may not always receive all the information we process.</p>
    <h3>Your right to rectification</h3>
    <p>You have the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-to-get-your-data-corrected/">right to ask us to rectify information</a> you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete. This right always applies.</p>
    <h3>Your right to erasure</h3>
    <p>You have the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-to-get-your-data-deleted/">right to ask us to erase</a> your personal information in certain circumstances.</p>
    <h3>Your right to restriction of  processing</h3>
    <p>You have the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-to-limit-how-organisations-use-your-data/">right  to ask us to restrict</a> the processing of your information in certain circumstances.</p>
    <h3>Your right to object to processing</h3>
    <p>You have the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/the-right-to-object-to-the-use-of-your-data/">right to object to processing</a> if we are able to process your information because the process forms part of our public tasks, or is in our legitimate interests.</p>
    <h3>Your right to data portability</h3>
    <p>This only applies to information you  have given us. You have the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-to-data-portability/">right to ask that we transfer the information</a> you gave us from one organisation to another, or give it to you. The right only applies if we are processing information  based on your consent or under, or in talks about entering into a contract and  the processing is automated.</p>
    <p>If  we are processing your information for criminal law enforcement purposes, your  rights are slightly different. Please see the <a href="privacy.htm#law-enforcement">Investigations  for law enforcement purposes</a> section of the notice.</p>
    <p>You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. We  have one month to respond to you.</p>
    <p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:DPO@hse.gov.uk">DPO@hse.gov.uk</a> if you wish to make a request.</p>
    <h2 id="service-adjustments">Service adjustments and retention</h2>
    <p>As a public authority and a provider of services to the public, we have  a legal duty to comply with the Equality Act (2010).</p>
    <p>This  means we need to make service adjustments for anyone with a disability who  contacts us in any capacity, to eliminate any barriers to accessing our  services. Our legal basis for processing this information is article 6(1)(c) of  the GDPR as we have a legal obligation to provide this. Our processing of  special category data, such as health information you give us, will be based on  article 9(2)(a), which means we need your consent.</p>
    <p>We'll  create a record of your adjustment requirements. These will give your name,  contact details and type of adjustment required, along with a brief description  of why it is required. Relevant staff can access this to ensure they are  communicating with you in the required way.</p>
    <h2 id="how-long"> How long we keep your data</h2>
    <p>We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purpose it was collected.</p>
    <p>At the end of the retention period, your personal data will be disposed  of securely.</p>
    <p>If  you have subscribed to an email alert or subscription service, we will keep  your personal data for as long as you are subscribed to that service or are  required to by law and we will delete that data if you have requested it to be  removed.</p>
    <h2 id="sharing">Sharing your information</h2>
    <p>We will not share your information with any third parties for the  purposes of direct marketing.</p>
    <p>We use data processors who are third parties who provide  elements of services for us. We have contracts in place with our data  processors. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal  information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will not share your  personal information with any organisation apart from us. They will hold it  securely and retain it for the period we instruct, in accordance with  appropriate data retention policies.</p>
    <p>In circumstances where we are a joint controller this notice will  outline how we will manage your data and the other party will also explain how  they manage your data.</p>
    <p>In  some circumstances we are legally obliged to share information. For example,  under a court order or where we cooperate with other European supervisory  authorities in handling complaints or investigations. We might also share  information with other regulatory bodies or law enforcement agencies in order  to further their, or our, objectives. In any scenario, we'll satisfy ourselves  that we have a lawful basis on which to share the information and document our  decision making and satisfy ourselves we have a legal basis on which to share  the information.</p>
    <p>In our capacity as UK regulator for enforcing health and  safety in the workplace, there are some circumstances where we must cooperate  with and help other supervisory authorities in the EEA, in handling complaints,  investigations and to regulate the movement of materials (e.g. explosives and  chemicals) This may lead to sharing personal information if it is relevant to  these tasks.</p>
    <p> We may also share your information in the event of the  non-payment of a Civil Monetary Penalty. If the debt remains outstanding after  the specified timeframe for payment, no payment plan is in place or an agreed  payment plan is not being adhered to, we may initiate formal proceedings to  recover the full amount of the unpaid penalty. As a result, the HSE will share  personal data with the litigation and recovery specialists it instructs in  order for them to identify assets and undertake recovery action through the  courts.</p>
    <h2 id="other-links">Links to other websites</h2>
    <p>Where  we provide links to websites of other organisations, this privacy notice does  not cover how that organisation processes personal information. We encourage  you to read the privacy notices on the other websites you visit. Please also  see <a href="disclaimer.htm">disclaimer</a> advice. </p>
    <div>
      <div> </div>
    </div>
    <h2 id="right-complain">Your right to complain</h2>
    <p>We  work to high standards when it comes to processing your personal information.  If you have queries or concerns, you can&nbsp;<a href="/contact/complain-about-hse.htm">make a complaint to HSE</a> and we'll respond.</p>
    <p> If you remain dissatisfied, you can <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/">make a  complaint</a> to the UK supervisory authority the Information Commissioners Office about  the way we process your personal information.</p>
    <h2 id="changes">Changes to this privacy notice</h2>
    <p> We keep our privacy notice under regular review to make sure it is up to  date and accurate. It was last updated 06 March 2019.</p>
    <h2 id="children">Children's information</h2>
    <p>We do not provide services directly to children or  proactively collect their personal information. However, we are sometimes given  or collect information about children while handling a complaint or conducting  an investigation. The information in the relevant parts of this notice applies  to children as well as adults.</p>
    <h2 id="how-contact">How you can contact us</h2>
    <h3>Calling our helpline</h3>
    <p>When you call our main  helpline (0300 003 1647), we collect  Calling Line Identification (CLI) information. This is the phone number you are  calling from (if it's not withheld). We hold a log of the phone number, date,  time and duration of the call, but do not audio record the call itself. We hold  this information for 90 days.</p>
    <p>We use this information to understand the demand for our  services and to improve how we operate. We may also use the number to call you  back if you have asked us to do so, if your call drops, or if there is a  problem with the line. We may also use it to check how many calls we have  received from it.</p>
    <p> We don't audio record any  calls, but we might make notes to help us answer your query. Other HSE  staff may also listen in during your call for training or quality assurance  purposes.</p>
    <p>We operate a textphone service  which is particularly useful if you are deaf, hard of hearing or speech  impaired. We do not keep any call information or messages left on the phone.</p>
    <p>We also hold statistical  information about the calls we receive for a number of years, but this does not  contain any personal data.</p>
    <h3>Social media</h3>
    <p>We only use social media to  deliver messages and do not gather personal data from this. Please refer to the  privacy policy of the social platform you are using.</p>

    <h4>Purpose and legal basis for  processing</h4>
    <p>Our purpose is to regulate Health and Safety in line with our statutory  duties under the Health and Safety at work Act 1974, including inspection and  investigation activities.</p>
    <p> The legal basis we rely on to process your personal data is article  6(1)(e) of the GDPR, which allows us to process personal data when this is  necessary to perform our public tasks as a regulator.</p>

And Schedule 1 part 2(6) of the DPA2018 which relates to  statutory and government purposes.</p>

    <p>No third parties have access to your personal information  unless the law allows them to do so. If you don't want information that  identifies you to be shared with the organisation you have raised a concern  about, we'll try to respect that. However, it is not always possible to handle  a concern on an anonymous basis so may contact you to discuss this.</p>
    <p>If you are acting on behalf of someone making a  complaint, we'll ask for information to satisfy us of your identity and if  relevant, ask for information to show you have authority to act on someone  else's behalf. </p>
    <h4>How long we keep your data</h4>

    <p> We are acting in our official capacity to investigate your complaint, so  you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data. There are  legitimate reasons why we may refuse your objection, which depend on why we are  processing it.</p>

    <h2 id="law-enforcement">Investigations  for law enforcement purposes</h2>
    <h3>Purpose and legal basis for  processing</h3>
    <p>As part of our statutory functions, we investigate and  prosecute individuals and organisations for alleged criminal offences committed  under the legislation we regulate (The health and Safety at work act 1974 and  other regulations) The Health and Safety Executive is named as a competent  authority for the purpose of Part 3 of the DPA 2018 which applies to the  processing of personal data by such authorities for law enforcement purposes.</p>
    <p> These purposes are set out at section31 of the DPA 2018 and  are the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal  offences or the execution of criminal penalties, which might include the  safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. Our  processing is either done because it is necessary for the performance of a task  relating to one of these purposes or with the consent of the individual.</p>
    <p>We process personal data for the purposes of law  enforcement of the legislation for which we are regulator in the following  three areas: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Criminal investigations</li>
      <li>Intelligence</li>
      <li>Financial recovery</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our processing can also include sensitive processing which  means processing special category data for law enforcement purposes. Where this  is the case we rely on either the consent of the individual or, provided the  processing is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purposes, on a  condition set out in Schedule 8 of the DPA 2018. Our Safeguards Policy explains  about our processing (including sensitive processing) for law enforcement  purposes, our procedures for complying with the data protection principles and  our policies for retention and erasure of any personal data.</p>
    <h3>What we need</h3>
    <p>When we  investigate an alleged criminal offence, we gather information and evidence  which might include information about victims, suspects, witnesses and other  individuals relevant to the circumstances and events. This information may  include samples and photographic or CCTV information.</p>
    <h3>Why we need it</h3>
    <p>In our role as a  competent authority, we need to establish whether offences have been committed  so that we can take legal action if appropriate. So, we'll gather information  relevant to our investigation which might include information about you. </p>
    <h3>What we do with it</h3>
    <p>We use your personal information for the purposes of our  investigation and, and for prosecution purposes if appropriate.</p>
    <p> In some circumstances we may share your personal information  with other law enforcement bodies/agencies during an investigation. We may  also share it with others such as expert witnesses or specialist investigators  working on behalf of the HSE.</p>
    <p> If we are considering taking legal action, we'll share this  information with our external legal counsel, the courts and any co-defendants  and their legal representatives. Court cases are held in public and so personal  data, including special category data, might be made public during proceedings.</p>
    <p> When we successfully prosecute someone, we may publish the  convicted individual's identity in our Annual Report, on our website or  distribute more widely to the media. </p>
    <h3>How long we keep your data</h3>
    <p>We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purpose  it was collected.</p>
    <p> At the end of the retention period, your personal data will be disposed  of securely.</p>
    <h3>What are your data protection rights?</h3>
    <p> You have a right to access  your personal data held by or for us. You also have a right to get inaccurate  data rectified and incomplete data completed, and for your personal data to be  erased in certain circumstances.</p>
    <p> We will provide further  information directly to data subjects in specific cases to enable them to  exercise their rights. This might be in cases where we are processing your  personal data that was collected without your knowledge.</p>
    <p>We will not do this where  doing so would be prejudicial to our investigation or for other reasons set out  in s.44 (4) Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
    <h3>Do we use any data processors?</h3>
    <p> Yes – we may use external legal counsel for court proceedings,  specialist investigators or testing facilities.</p>
