    <p>Research  has shown that general training in lifting techniques is an ineffective way of  controlling the risks of manual handling in businesses. By getting help to  change the way you work, you can reduce manual handling risks and avoid paying  for ineffective or unnecessary training. </p>
    <p>The  categories below describe the different kinds of help you may need and gives  examples of how these have been implemented in practice. Comparing your circumstances to  these, should help you get the most suitable type of help for your  business.</p>
<h2>Comprehensive approach to managing MSD risks in your business</h2>
    <p>Do you need someone to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>assess and prioritise your risks</li>
      <li>provide advice on control measures and their cost effectiveness</li>
      <li>identify, implement or tailor management systems to help you  prevent, reduce or manage risks</li>
      <li>provide or recommend an occupational health provider to advise  on management of cases</li>
      <li>advise you how to involve your employees and their  representatives </li>
      <li>suggest ways of monitoring and measuring performance</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="accordion">
      
  <h3 id="multiple">Example - manufacturing plant</h3>
<div>
<p>The new owners of a manufacturing plant recognised they had investment  decisions to make, and were aware of the history of MSD claims against the  previous owners. They used a consultant to map the MSD risks. She identified  the greatest risks through observation, and shortlisted options for  improvements in consultation with managers and workers. She discussed return on  investment with the new owners to help plan for shorter and longer-term  measures. The consultant recommended an occupational health service provider to  assist with what the company called their ‘walking wounded’.</p>
</div></div>
  
<h2>MSD risk assessment</h2>
<p>Do you need help to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>carry out risk assessments for you</li>
  <li>train your employees to carry out risk assessments </li>
  <li>advise how to involve workers or representatives</li>
  <li>identify practical and effective control measures</li>
</ul>
  

 <div class="accordion"> 
  <h3 id="risk-assessment">Example - food processing and packaging plant</h3><div>
  <p>Following  several cases of MSDs, a consultant was brought into a food processing and  packaging plant to undertake risk assessments. The consultant used the Assessment of Repetitive Tasks Tool  (ART Tool) to identify higher risk tasks, and put together practical  solutions in consultation with supervisors and workers. The consultant also  trained staff in the business to use the ART tool for themselves. Later  assessments were carried out by workers, with support from the consultant in  more complex cases.</p>
</div></div>

<h2>Workplace organisation and design changes</h2>
<p>Do you need help to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>design-out or reduce MSD risks </li>
  <li>identify changes to how work is organised or to the workplace</li>
  <li>carry out a cost-benefit analysis</li>
  <li>involve workers and their representatives in designing and  implementing any changes</li>
  <li>identify suitable equipment</li>
</ul>


 <div class="accordion">  
   
  <h3 id="workplace1">Example - construction project</h3><div>
  <p>A  construction project required the transport of heavy materials down stairwells.  A specialist materials handling designer was consulted, and an overhead  conveyor with bespoke cradles was designed and installed. This significantly  reduced the risks of workers suffering  health problems from manual handling and improved productivity. The  workers received training specific to the equipment and process, and reported  that they felt their health and safety was valued by their employer.</p>
</div></div> 

<h2>Changing attitudes, behaviours and providing tailored training</h2>
<p>Do you need help in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>analysing working practices to fully appreciate the context and  demands of the work</li>
  <li>engaging management and involving workers and their  representatives </li>
  <li>providing tailored training which will help change attitudes and  behaviours</li>
  <li>making better use of equipment</li>
</ul>


  <div class="accordion">   
  <h3 id="training">Example - NHS Trust</h3><div>
  <p>An NHS trust was concerned about an increasing number of  accidents where slide sheets were used to move patients. A back-care adviser  reviewed the accidents and reported on working practices. The adviser found  staff were unsure about which type of slide sheet to select for the task and  found them difficult to use. Involving staff in the design and use, they  developed a single slide sheet, suitable for using in all situations. This ended  confusion over which sheet to use and staff found the new sheet easier to use. Staff  training was tailored to the task, the equipment and environment. MSD-related  incidents were reduced by 80%.</p>
</div></div> 




    <h2>Where you can get help</h2>
    <p>Providers should be able to prove they can deliver what you  need. Ask them for evidence of practical hands-on experience and track-record. </p>
    <p>Trainers need to demonstrate they have the delivery skills  to empower and engage your workforce and business. Your trade body may be able  to advise you on suitable providers.</p>
