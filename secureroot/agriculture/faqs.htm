        <div>
          <p>You should always wear an  appropriate helmet when riding an ATV. The type of helmet chosen should be based on an assessment of the  circumstances in which the ATV will be used, e.g. the types of surface  travelled over and anticipated speeds. </p>
          <p>The harder the surface and  higher the speed the greater the degree of protection needed. </p>
          <p>Further information on  choosing the appropriate helmet can be found in <a href="../pubns/ais33.pdf">AIS 33 Safe Use of All Terrain  Vehicles in agriculture and forestry</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>NB:</strong> Forestry  helmets and industrial hard hats are not acceptable for any ATV operations.</p>

        <div>
          <p>It is against the law to  allow a child under 13 to ride on or drive agricultural self-propelled machines  (such as tractors) and certain other farm machinery. </p>
          <p>The law also requires that  employers make sure their risk assessment for young people under the age of 18  takes full account of their inexperience, immaturity and lack of awareness of  relevant risks.</p>
          <p> The agriculture topic pages on <a href="topics/children.htm">Children - driving or operating farm machinery</a> provide more information.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Risk assessment is a careful look at what, in your business, could cause harm to people, so that you can decide whether you have taken enough precautions or should do more. </p>
          <p>The law does not expect you to eliminate all risk, but to protect  people as far as 'reasonably practicable'. Making the assessment and taking  action is what matters.</p>
          <p>Further guidance is available on the agriculture <a href="topics/risk-assessment.htm"> topic pages</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="q5"><a href="#q5">What toilet and washing facilities do I need to provide on my farm for workers?</a></h3>
        <div>
          <p>You must provide welfare  facilities to protect workers from risks to their health. You may be able to  provide these by allowing access to the farmhouse toilets and washing  facilities, but you must ensure that you keep washing facilities and food  preparation areas separate. </p>
          <p>Facilities must be near the worksite and should be available during all working hours. Further information on the agriculture pages <a href="topics/welfare.htm#toilet">toilet  and welfare facilities</a> and in HSE's free leaflet <a href="../pubns/indg244.htm">Workplace health, safety and welfare: A short guide for managers</a> are available.</p>
          <p>Where remote worksites are used  irregularly, for example harvesting crops, portable toilets fitted with  adequate washing facilities, including soap and towels, are acceptable.</p>

        <h3 id="q6"><a href="#q6">What washing facilities do I need to provide for visitors?</a></h3>
        <div>

      <h2 id="c5">Pesticides</h2>
      <div class="accordion">
        <h3 id="q8"><a href="#q8">What training do I need for spraying or using pesticides?</a></h3>
        <div>
          <p>Everyone who uses a plant protection product professionally must be trained. In some situations the law requires that users have a recognised certificate of competence or are directly and personally supervised by someone with such a certificate. This requirement applies primarily to those providing a commercial service and who are applying professional agricultural products.</p>
          <p>There are exemptions and these are described in the <a href="../pesticides/using-pesticides/codes-of-practice/code-of-practice-for-using-plant-protection-products.htm">Code of Practice for  Using Plant Protection Products</a> which apply to amateur, domestic use and  vertebrate control, and in some circumstances to users born before the 31 December 1964. Further information in the Code of Practice.</p>
          <p>Additional information on using pesticides safely can  be found on the <a href="topics/pesticides.htm">agriculture topic pages</a>.</p>
          <p>The requirements for certification will continue until  October/November 2011 when a new UK Regulation which implements the Sustainable  Use Directive (SUD) - Directive 2009/128/EEC  - comes into force.<strong> </strong></p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="q9"><a href="#q9">Who do I contact if I am concerned about  the misuse or spraying of pesticides?</a></h3>
        <div>
          <p>If you, your family, wildlife, or the environment, have been affected by exposure to pesticides you  are strongly advised to report it. The department to contact depends on the  type of incident you wish to report. Such incidents are taken very seriously  but they need to be reported as soon as possible for an effective investigation  to be undertaken.</p>
          <p>Most of the pesticide-related complaints referred to HSE are concerns about the storage and  use of pesticides (plant protection products or biocides) on farms, which mainly  involve drift from spraying operations.</p>
          <p>If you feel unwell or are  worried about your health, you should seek medical advice. If possible, obtain as much information about the spray that caused the incident as you can as this  will help your GP or doctor. Once you have done this, you should report the incident to the HSE office nearest to the area where the incident took place.</p>
          <p>Further information is available on <a href="../contact/concerns.htm">reporting complaints or concerns</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="c6">Pesticides and veterinary medicines</h2>
      <div class="accordion">
        <h3 id="q10"><a href="#q10">What are the requirements when using veterinary medicines and sheep dips?</a></h3>
        <div>
          <p>Veterinary medicines and sheep  dips may  contain hazardous substances. If mishandled, they can make you ill, harm the  sheep or pollute the environment. </p>
          <p>As with other substances  hazardous to health before using these medicines and dips you should: </p>
          <ul>

        <h3 id="q11"><a href="#q11">Who do I notify  that I am storing ammonium nitrate and what measures do I need to take?</a></h3>
        <div>
          <p>From 6 April 2013, the requirements to notify storage of ammonium nitrate have   changed. Under the Dangerous Substances (Notification and Marking of Sites)   Regulations 1990 (NAMOS), there are legal requirements relating to notification   and marking of sites that store certain amounts of dangerous substances or   â€˜relevant ammonium nitrate mixturesâ€™</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="namos.htm">Arrangements on how to notify</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>HSE has also produced a <a href="../explosives/ammonium/chklist.pdf">self-help  checklist </a>to help duty holders to determine if they have taken sufficient measure to   ensure the safe storage and handling of the material. More detailed guidance is   contained in HSE's free leaflet <a href="../pubns/indg230.pdf">INDG230 Storing and Handling Ammonium Nitrate </a>.</p>

        <h3 id="q12"><a href="#q12">What are the requirements for keeping cattle in fields with public access?</a></h3>
        <div>
          <p>If you keep cattle in  fields where either the public have a statutory right of access or you have  given permission for members of the public to be present you should:</p>
          <ul >
            <li>ensure that bulls [i.e. uncastrated and aged 10 months or over] of recognised dairy breeds are <strong>not</strong> kept in those fields under any circumstances.</li>
            <li>ensure that bulls of all other breeds are only kept in fields with public access if accompanied by cows or heifers. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Keepers of animals are in most cases held legally responsible for injuries caused by their stock. Before putting any cattle, including bulls, in fields with public access you should assess their likely behaviour when members of the public â€“ perhaps walking dogs or with children - are present. If possible, keep cows with calves a foot away from fields with public access.</p>
          <p>Consider the nature of the particular cattle you  intend to put in fields with public access. Check that paths are clearly marked  and that fences are secure and well maintained.</p>
          <p>If you have an animal known to be aggressive you  should not keep it in a field with public access. It is good practice to display signs warning the public when a bull or cows with calves are present in  an area. These signs should not be misleading and must be taken down or covered  when bulls etc are no longer present.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Children who live on farms  and their friends can find farms exciting places to explore.Â  Unfortunately, they regularly have accidents  on farms and each year some children are seriously hurt or die as a  result.</p>
          <p>You should consider the risks to children from  vehicles and machinery, falls, falling objects, drowning and asphyxiation, injury and ill health from animals, fire and hazardous substances.</p>
          <p>Remember, children can be killed or seriously injured  by incidents that may not cause serious harm to adults.</p>
          <p>More information about children operating agricultural machinery is given in the section on 'Children and tractors'.</p>

          <p>If OHPLs run across  your land, ask your distribution network operator (DNO) if they can be  re-routed, put underground, or raised. If that cannot be done, make sure you  have a map of the routes of the lines (available from your DNO) and that  visiting workers such as contractors have copies (include details of OHPLs in  contracts).</p>
