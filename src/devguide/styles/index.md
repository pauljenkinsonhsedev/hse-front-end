# Welcome to your Pattern Library

This prototyping tool is based on the 'Atomic design' methodology following the pattern, atoms - molecules - organisms - templates - pages.

Here you will find a library of components with example html markup. This library has been created to enforce consistency in the design and intended to be incoprorated as part of your project workflow. This flexible approach allows you to make cosmetic changes at a granular level so you can visualise your components before using in production. Treat this library as a living thing that can mature with your project.

Use this guide to fine tune and extend themes.
